# This file contains all parameters to configure MATRIX
# In the run_folders this is the link to the central configuration file
# in MATRIX/config/; you can replace the link by a copy to have individual 
# configurations for the different processes

# Editor to be used to edit input files from MATRIX shell
# (default: use the one specified under environmental variable EDITOR)

## cluster parameter ##
###=================###
# Name of cluster currently supported: 
#   slurm, LSF (eg, lxplus), condor_lxplus (special version working on lxplus HTCondor),
#   condor, PBS, Torque, SGE (PSB and Torque/OpenPBS are identical at the moment)
#cluster_name = slurm

# Queue/Partition of cluster to be used for running
#cluster_queue = 2nw

# Maximal runtime for a single process on a single node,
# too low values may lead failure of the code
#cluster_runtime = 2-00:00:00

# add customizable lines at the beginning of cluster submission file
# this allows to add certain cluster-specific requirements as options to the submission
# eg: cluster_submit_line1 = "#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=4000"
#     to increase the memory of a slurm job on certain clusters
# or you can add commands to the bash commands to source or export stuff on the nodes:
# eg: cluster_submit_line2 = "source /PATH/"
# or: cluster_submit_line3 = "export YOUR_FAVOURITE_VARIABL=/PATH/"
#
# You can add as many lines as you want of the structure "cluster_submit_lineX", where X 
# is a number which defines the order of the lines added to the submission file.
# If you want/need to use "#", "%" or "=" signs you need to put quotes around the line: "#blah" !
#cluster_submit_line1 = "line 1 added to submission file"
#cluster_submit_line2 = "line 2"
#cluster_submit_line3 = "line 3"
#        ...          =   ...

# max number of parallel runs:
# maximum number of cores used for multicore (default: maximal cores available on the machine); 
# max number of used nodes at the same time for cluster (default: not limited)
#max_nr_parallel_jobs = 400 # when commented the defaults are used

# this is a fail-safe: it prevents running more jobs than parallel_job_limit; the code stops 
# with a warning, waiting for user input when exceeding this limit (default: 5000)
parallel_job_limit = 10000 # when commented the default is used

# max jobs in cluster queue:
# maximum number of jobs that can be submitted to the cluster queue. If the cluster queue has 
# more jobs than max_jobs_in_cluster_queue MATRIX will wait until there are less (default: not limited)
#max_jobs_in_cluster_queue = 400 # when commented the default is used

###=============###
## run parameter ##
###=============###

# you can specify the path to the process executable; this will also overwrite the soft link to the 
# executable in the run folders; makes the folder portable to other machines; 
# MUST BE A FULL PATH STARTING WITH "/"
#path_to_executable = /<path_to_MATRIX>/bin

# max number of restarts of runs (which may have failed) default=2
max_restarts = 1 # when commented the default is used

###=====================###
## compilation parameter ##
###=====================###

# maximum number of cores used for compilation (default: maximal cores available on the machine); 
#nr_cores = 16 # when commented the default is used

# you can specify the path to lhapdf-config executable;  not required if lhapdf-config executable 
# accessible from command line (will be determined automatically in that case)
#path_to_lhapdf = /PATH/lhapdf-config  # !absolute path!
# you can specify the path to ginac, if already installed locally; ginac will not be compiled in this case
#path_to_ginac = /PATH/ginac-install/  # !absolute path!

# you can specify the path to cln, if already installed locally; cln will not be compiled in this case
#path_to_cln = /PATH/cln-install/  # !absolute path!

# you can specify the path to chaplin, if already installed locally; chaplin will not be compiled in this case
#path_to_chaplin = /PATH/chaplin-install/  # !absolute path!

# you can specify the path to the libfortran libary, usually found by the system automatically
# NOTE: this path must also be set if the libquadmath library is not found
# NOTE: this path can be also used if other libaries are missing during the compilation process
#path_to_libgfortran = /PATH/x86_64-linux-gnu/  # !absolute path!

# you can specify the path to gsl-config executable;  not required if gsl-config executable 
# accessible from command line (will be determined automatically in that case)
#path_to_gsl = /PATH/gsl-config  # !absolute path!
